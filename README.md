This repository contains a collection of Android projects that I have developed during my university studies and while taking Kotlin courses on the Dicoding platform.

These projects were created as part of my learning journey to improve my skills in Android development, covering topics such as Kotlin programming, Android SDK usage, user interface design, navigation, API integration, and local data storage.
